After loading up an SQL workbench, you may uncomment the lines in createAll as needed to create a database, and use the database. Please then run the createAll script followed by the loadAll script. If you need to restart for any reason please run the dropAll script and then recreate the tables using createAll. 

queryAll queriesmay be uncommented as needed and may be altared in places where the queries take specific inputs.
